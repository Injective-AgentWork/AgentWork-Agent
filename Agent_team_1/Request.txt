I need to develop a UI website to provide information about flights and the airline's services. Additionally, customers should be able to book tickets through the Airline website.

Customer Features
    *View general information and details about flights.
    *Search for flights.
    *Book tickets (no online payment integration required).
    *Cancel tickets within the allowed cancellation period.
    *Track information about booked flights.
Admin Features
    *Publish information (introductions, promotions, announcements, news, etc.) about the airline.
    *Input data about aircraft (ID, manufacturer, seat details, etc.).
    *Input data about flights (flight number, aircraft, departure point, destination, departure time, etc.).
    *View and generate reports on customer ticket bookings.
    *Modify departure times (delay flights) if necessary.
NOTES
    *Refer to airline websites to better understand business functions.
    *Creatively design QAirline’s unique brand identity.
    *Just develop the interface of this website using HTML, CSS or other framework like React … (not *include backend).
Please create a landing page to introduce the website .

    You just use html and css. You can use internet and find some suitable boostrap or tailwind.
    This Web need the logo and background image
